# grunt-hub

A Grunt task to watch and run tasks on multiple Grunt projects, optionally in order of dependencies between Gruntfiles.

## Create a Grunt Hub

A Grunt Hub is just a folder with a [Gruntfile][getting_started] and this
grunt plugin installed. To create one do:

```
mkdir grunt-hub && cd grunt-hub
npm install grunt-hub
cp -R node_modules/grunt-hub/tasks/init/hub/* .
```

Then edit the Gruntfile file to point to your other Grunt projects and run:
`grunt hub`.

### Integrate With an Existing Grunt Project

Install this grunt plugin next to your project's
[Gruntfile][getting_started] with: `npm install grunt-hub`

Then add this line to your project's Gruntfile:

```javascript
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-hub');
```

## Watching Forever

The common use for grunt-hub is for a development server. Where you would
like to watch multiple projects and compile the SASS or concat/minify JS upon
every project as you edit.

Depending on your system, there are various ways to ensure the grunt-hub stays
alive. Such as with
[upstart and monit](http://howtonode.org/deploying-node-upstart-monit).

A simple way is to use `nohup` and create a `start.sh` script:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
DIR=`dirname $0`
/usr/bin/nohup /usr/local/bin/grunt --base $DIR hub --no-color &
echo "Grunt Hub Started"
```

and a `stop.sh` script:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
ps -ef | sed -n '/grunt/{/grep/!p;}' | awk '{print$2}' | xargs -I kill {}
echo "Grunt Hub Stopped"
```

Put these in your grunt-hub folder and run `./start.sh` to start and
`./stop.sh` to stop.

### Using [forever](https://npmjs.org/package/forever)

`forever` is a another great way to watch multiple grunt projects forever.

* Install `npm install forever grunt grunt-cli grunt-hub --save-dev`
* Add a start script to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-grunt-hub",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "forever ./node_modules/.bin/grunt hub"
  }
}
```

* Now you can start your hub with `npm start`.

## Configuring

This plugin includes a `hub` task and overrides the `watch` task.

### `hub` task

The hub task is for running tasks on multiple projects. It would like to know
which Gruntfiles to use and which tasks to run on each Grunt project. For example
if I would like to `lint` and `test` on every Grunt project one folder up:

```javascript
grunt.initConfig({
  hub: {
    all: {
      src: ['../*/Gruntfile.js'],
      tasks: ['jshint', 'nodeunit'],
    },
  },
});
```

If `tasks` were omitted, it will run the `default` tasks.

You can override tasks on the cli with args: `grunt hub:all:watch` will run the `watch` task on all projects instead of `jshint, nodeunit`.

#### options

##### `dependencyFn`
Default: no dependencies

Set to either a string or a function. If a string, must be one of the supported default dependency functions below. If a function, it will be passed two arguments--(1) an absolute path to a Gruntfile, and (2) an array containing absolute paths to all Gruntfiles matched by the glob--and is expected to return an array of absolute paths to the Gruntfiles the given Gruntfile depends on. (Note: the `hub` task will fail if `dependencyFn` returns a Gruntfile that is not matched by the `src` glob, or if paths returned are not absolute.)

If a `dependencyFn` is specified, then tasks for each Gruntfile will only run once the tasks for all dependent Gruntfiles have completed. If an error occurs running `dependencyFn`, an error is printed, and the task proceeds under the assumption that Gruntfile has no dependencies.

Default dependency functions:
 * `"bower"` - Attempt to read a `bower.json` from the same directory as the Gruntfile. Any relative paths in `dependencies` or `devDependencies` from that `bower.json` will be searched for Gruntfiles, and any Gruntfiles found will be returned as dependencies.
   * Example: `projectA/bower.json` has the following lines in its `dependencies`: (`"projectB": "../projectB"`) and (`"projectC": "../projectC"`). The dependencies for `projectA/Gruntfile.js` will then be `["/path/to/projectB/Gruntfile.js", "/path/to/projectC/Gruntfile.js"]`, assuming that both files exist and are in the `src` glob.

##### ~~`concurrent`~~
~~Default: `3`~~

~~Set to the number of concurrent task runs to spawn.~~

***Currently disabled, pending merge of [caolan/async#637](https://github.com/caolan/async/pull/637).***

##### `bufferOutput`
Default: `false`

Set to `true` to buffer output of running tasks, and print all output from a task as a batch once it completes.

##### `allowSelf`
Default: `false`

By default, hub will skip its own Gruntfile. Set to `true` to allow hub to
include itself.

**Note:** Only set this for tasks which are not part of the `default`
task of their respective Gruntfile, or an infinite loop will occur.

```
hub: {
  all: {
    options: {
      allowSelf: true
    },
    src: ['./Gruntfile.js', '../client1/Gruntfile.js', '../client2/Gruntfile.js'],
  },
},
```

## Where did the `watch` task go?

It isn't necessary. Just `npm install grunt-contrib-watch --save-dev` into your project folders. Then either add the `watch` task to your tasks list in your hub task config. Or run with `grunt hub:target:watch`.
